		<h3>Generally all form elements should be enclosed within form tag. A radio button is also represented by input tag with type = radio</h3>
		<form>
			<p>Select the cities which you have visited the most: </p>
			
			<input type="radio" name="mostVisitedCity">Delhi <br>
			<input type="radio" name="mostVisitedCity" checked>Bangalore <br>
			<input type="radio" name="mostVisitedCity">Chennai <br>
			<input type="radio" name="mostVisitedCity">Kolkata <br>
		</form>
		
		<h3>Note that in order to ensure that only one of the multiple radio buttons is selectable, you have to create a set of those radio buttons which is done by giving same name to the radio buttons belonging to the same set which tells the browser that these radio buttons belong to the same set and at any moment only one of them shoud be selected.</h3>
		<h3>To have a radio selected by default, use checked within the input tag as in the case of Bangalore above.</h3>
